The repository for uploading UCSB [CS263: Runtime System](http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~cs263/index.html) code. This readme is basically a copy of our project vision, but progress will be updated regularly.

**Project Idea**

Performance comparisons

Python: PyPy, IronPython, PyPy/JIT, CPython, other. Use 5+ real programs you find via github or elsewhere (http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org has some small programs, if you use these, then you need a minimum of 10 programs)

**Interpreters to be compared**

PyPy, IronPython, PyPy/JIT, CPython,Jython.(Other interpreters to be explored later)

**Parameters to be measured**

Overall user runtime, memory usage, compressed source code size, CPU time over all threads, CPU load for each core.

Other parameters might be decided to compare:

(throughput? machine-learning based approaches to performance adaptation?)

**Benchmark Programs**

We are going to start with the programs compared in Benchmark Games and meanwhile find programs on github. We will add them in the benchmark if found. [The programs compared in Benchmark Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Computer_Language_Benchmarks_Game) including: binary-trees chameneos-redux fannkuch-redux fasta k-nucleotide mandelbrot meteor-contest n-body pidigits regex-redux reverse-complement spectral-norm thread-ring.
